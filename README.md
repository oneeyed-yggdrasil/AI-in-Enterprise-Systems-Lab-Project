Perhaps you've engaged in the game of rock-paper-scissors in the past, employing it to determine responsibilities like covering dinner expenses or selecting team members. For those who are not acquainted with it, rock-paper-scissors is a hand game designed for two or more players. The participants utter the words "**rock**, **paper**, **scissors**" and subsequently mold their hands into one of three shapes: a fist representing a rock, a palm facing downward for paper, or two fingers extended for scissors. 

# The Rules
* **Rock** smashes **Scissors**.
* **Paper** covers **Rock**.
* **Scissors** cut **Paper**.

# The Code
The user is prompted to input their choice (**Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**), and the program checks whether the input is valid. If the input is valid, the bot randomly selects its choice, and the game logic determines the winner or declares a tie. If the user's input is not one of the valid options, the program prints "Wrong Input Try Again" to prompt the user to enter a valid choice.
