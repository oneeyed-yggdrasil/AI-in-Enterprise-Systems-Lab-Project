# AI-in-Enterprise-Systems-Lab-Project
This is the designated repository for storing **AI-related Enterprise Lab Assignments**. Each assignment is neatly organized within its own **dedicated folder** for easy access and management.

# Lab 1  
Perhaps you've engaged in the game of rock-paper-scissors in the past, employing it to determine responsibilities like covering dinner expenses or selecting team members. For those who are not acquainted with it, rock-paper-scissors is a hand game designed for two or more players. The participants utter the words "**rock**, **paper**, **scissors**" and subsequently mold their hands into one of three shapes: a fist representing a rock, a palm facing downward for paper, or two fingers extended for scissors. 

### The Rules
* **Rock** smashes **Scissors**.
* **Paper** covers **Rock**.
* **Scissors** cut **Paper**.

### The Code
The user is prompted to input their choice (**Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**), and the program checks whether the input is valid. If the input is valid, the bot randomly selects its choice, and the game logic determines the winner or declares a tie. If the user's input is not one of the valid options, the program prints "Wrong Input Try Again" to prompt the user to enter a valid choice.

# Lab 2
This repository contains code for diagnosing breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The provided Python script performs the following tasks:

### Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning
**Data Import and Preprocessing**: The script imports necessary libraries and fetches the breast cancer Wisconsin diagnostic dataset. It then preprocesses the data by splitting it into training and testing sets and standardizing the features.

**Model Building**: A Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is built using the preprocessed training data.

**Model Evaluation**: The trained model is used to predict the target labels for the test set. The accuracy of the model is computed, and a detailed classification report is generated to evaluate the model's performance.
